         <h3>Emotional Intelligence</h3>
           <br><br>
           <p>What I believe emotional intelligence to be is ways to self-regulate/ monitor and 
               channel one's moods and emotions in order to be in optimal condtion when 
               performing tasks. Emotional intelligence also includes (though is not limited to) 
               understanding one's own strengths and weaknesses, values, goals and being practicing
               resillience in times of pressure. Empathy also plays a huge role in emotional intelligence.
