          <h3> Neuroplasticity</h3>
          <br>
          <p> 
            Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity means that one’s mind is open and will not have a fixed mindset. Knowing that your brain is malleable and not stuck a certain way, it leads to the possibility of purposeful change and re-wiring. 
            I will try to make what I am doing more meaningful, for instance, in terms of coding, I will look back at why I am coding in the first place instead of getting stumped about how hard it is. I will also be engaging with the principle “use it or lose it” alot, using coding as an example again, I will make sure to code daily so that the connection pathways continue to get stronger and not die out.
            Also Repetitive practice over and over on a problem, plus looking at the problem from different angles (e.g. youtube video tutorial, article reading) to help build stronger connections.

            This is an article by huffpost outlining the fundamentals of neuroplasticity. What makes it relevant is that it has links to other author’s books on neuro plasticity making it more credible. It also explains most of the fundamentals with an easy and simple simile, making it easy to understand.
            I knew about the brain being malleable and that rewiring was possible but it wasn’t until going over this section of the sprint till I realised “why aren’t I keeping this as a crucial part of my general thinking?”. I feel like understanding more and more of neuroplasticity is a super effective tool I should be utilising more often, especially with coding.
            Instead of self labelling myself when I get something wrong as a ‘failure’ or telling myself ‘I can’t do it’, I will remind myself ‘not yet’. I will try my best to reward myself mentally for the process rather than have my sights fixed on ‘getting it all right’. Progress over everything.

          <h3> Learning Plan </h3>
          <br>
          <p> 
Learning Plan:
These understandings help to specify my learning plan, to make more deliberate decisions in what I put my time and effort towards. Learning about neuroplasticity, makes me want to add to my learning plan.
