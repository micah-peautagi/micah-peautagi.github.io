        <h3>TECH:</h3>

      <p>  Cmd line
        The command line is a user interface that allows us to give the computer commands such as: creating folders/files, deleting folders/files, moving around the computer and many more. You are able to do the same things on the computer through the command line using your mouse however, the command line is faster than the GUI (Graphical user interface) if used properly. 
        
        
        In terms of an analogy I would say the command line is like a video game. If it were a fighting game on Playstation, in order to make your character punch or kick it would require you give commands by pushing buttons on the controller, then you’re character will act accordingly. Relating this to the command line, the controller/buttons would your keyboard/keys and the character would be your user interface.
        
        
         I did not stick to the timebox guidelines all the way through, I had actually gone over time with exploring, watching videos about the command line. Next time, I will study with more focus on achieving the learning competencies. Though the week hasn’t started yet, I will definitely go over this again as well as a few of the stretch learning.
        
        
         5 commands I used were: cd (changes directory e.g cd Desktop), .. (goes back a directory), ../.. (goes back two directories), mkdir (make directory - a folder), and ls (lists directories). I was almost still sure that I am way faster at using the GUI than I ever would be at the command line, until I realised how much faster it is to create folders/files (e.g. a 100 folders) using the command line than it would be using the GUI.
        
        
        Git / Github
        
        
        Git is a distributed version control system, basically a tool which is typically installed in our computer that helps maintain/manage a detailed history of a project, where as Github is a centralized service that allows multiple people to work collaboratively on source code.
         
        Git data can be thought of as snapshots at a particular moment in time (like a picture) because everytime you commit (save the current state of project in Git) it basically takes a picture of your data and holds onto it for you to look at anytime. I did stick more to the timebox suggestions during this part because I kept more focus on focusing purely on the learning competencies whilst keeping an eye on Toggl.

        GitHub workflow is the order of which a repository is forked (copied) into a GitHub personal account, then cloned (copied) to a local server where commits are done. Then through an origin remote (the repository cloned from - our personal fork), commits are pulled from the local server and put into a featured branch on the GitHub personal account. From there pull requests are made on the GitHub website, where we can merge our commits to the main repository, as well as make comments/requests and other notes.
        
        
        What I noticed about my own learning was that I tended to get sidetracked by youtube videos related to the topic, however, which do not help me to achieve the learning competencies. I would listen in to the infinite amount of information and get worried about all this information I need to remember. When I was confused about a term or something I was reading I would straight away Google or Youtube for the answer. At this point I don’t think I’d do anything different if I were to repeat the learning exploration again.
        
        
        If I were to describe stage and commit to a non-tech-savvy friend I would relate stage to a draft essay and commit to a completed/submitted essay. Just like a draft essay, you edit/fix/add/delete data (words) and even when you could just commit it (like submitting an essay), you may just decide to edit it once again before you do so. Because once you submit the essay (commit the data), there isn’t much else you could do to change your grade that you will get for it at that point.
        
        
        
        Branch, Pull, Merge Primer
        
        
        Master is the main branch where the most ideal version of a project’s code resides. The birth of this master branch is the result of cloning or downloading a project (repository) from a remote server (GitHub) to local Git.
        
        
        A Branch is created when someone wants to make changes/edits, commit changes etc, and is able to test/implement them without affecting the master branch, this is to be sure that no questionable code is unnecessarily added.
        
        
        I was surprised by the amount of new terms that are involved with Git such as pull-requests, fork, clone etc, instead of generic phrases. It takes a little bit longer to understand the online video tutorials, I find myself rewinding parts at least 2-3 times over because I am unable to fully comprehend a sentence. This also sidetracks me because when I hear new terms I have to stop and search it up online though it isn’t part of the learning competencies.
