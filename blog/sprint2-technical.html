          <h3> What is inline and what does it mean?</h3>
          <p>Inline means exactly how it sounds, but for easier understing think of it in terms of a sentence. Now a sentence follows along one line, like the one you're reading now right?
            When an element has (display: inline;), it cannot have height or width, or even a margin that goes vertically. An example of an inline element is the element (span), (Span) is used when styling a group of words in the same/different paragraph/s. Where as the (div) tag is a inline-block element.  </p>

      <div><h4>Styles Associated:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Margin-left</li>
                <li>Margin-left</li>
                <li>Padding-left</li>
                <li>Padding-right</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
          
     

          <h3>What is inline-block and what does it mean?</h3>
          <p>With inline block elements, you are able to alter the height and width of an element. Elements with (display: inline-block) can have a width and a height where as elements with (display: inline) cannot.
            </p>
            <div><h4>Styles Associated:</h4>

                    <li>Margin</li>
                    <li>Padding</li>
                    <li>Height</li>
