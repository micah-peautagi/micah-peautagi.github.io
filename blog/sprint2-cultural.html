        <h2>My commitment:</h2>
        <br>
        <p>I WILL stay committed to this programme! Monday to Friday I will study from 3pm to 11pm on the days where I do not have afternoon work, and on the days I do I will put the hours in through the weekend. I will be sure to sustain myself well by doing grocery shopping with ‘good’ foods and not get in the habit of eating study stress food (a.k.a. Chocolate etc). I will communicate via slack with my facilitator and peers, and offer help where I am able to give.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I will first google for the answers I’m looking for, and if that doesn’t help I will seek help via cohort friends or the foundations slack channel. Last resort is to ask my facilitator, I was advised it is better to ask and get the answer faster rather than spend an unhealthy amount of time searching for it.
            </p>
