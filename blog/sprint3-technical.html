         <h3>An analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h3>
           <br><br>
        
        
        <p>HTML is like a birthday card. A simple, plain card, that has nothing but “happy birthday” written on it in black. What this card needs to improve, is style. For this you would add colour, probably change the font etc. To change/edit style and appearance of HTML, you need CSS. While HTML is the main content, to edit it’s looks you use CSS.</p>

        <h3>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'</h3>
        <p>Programming languages (such as Javascript) use flow control and loops to perform certain requirements when conditions are fulfilled. Control flow is the order that the computer executes statements in a script, while reading a script, control flow doesn’t just mean read from start to finish. However, you must look at the program structure to see how it affects order and execution. There are many different kinds of loops but what a loop basically does is repeat an action until a certain condition is fulfilled. 

            I will use the example of a morning routine to explain control flow and loops:
            
            In the morning people tend to have a structure or a pattern they perform each morning to get ready, however, it isn’t always in the same order. IF/ELSE also applies to these conditional tasks. For example, before someone leaves to work they would have to perhaps ‘take a shower’, if they don’t do this they will probably smell/look bad. Typically, they would repeat this process everyday or in other words “loop” every morning. However, perhaps this someone only showers if he is leaving home, and today is his day off therefore he doesn’t require a shower. In relation to control flow, instead of reading a script from start to finish, look at the program structure to see how it affects any order of execution.</p>

            Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.
             </h3>

        
        
        <p>The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface used for HTML documents. It represents a webpage as nodes and objects so that certain programming elements (like Javascript!) can make changes to the document, it’s style and it’s content. Javascript uses the DOM to manipulate elements inside of the HTML.

        <h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Objects and Arrays are important features in the Javascript programming language as they are both known as data sets. They both store data, but they both store it differently. Objects store collections of data, with each value being stored against a specific key. Names for these keys are specific of the data in an objects collection (the keys are names of the data). The bits of data can then be accessed by typing in the object and it’s key: objectName.Keyname.

        <h3>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            Functions are sequences of code that is written (in Javascript and other programming languages) and can be used multiple times again.

    <h3>Emotional Intelligence</h3>
      <br><br>
      <p>What I believe emotional intelligence to be is ways to self-regulate/ monitor and 
          channel one's moods and emotions in order to be in optimal condtion when 
          performing tasks. Emotional intelligence also includes (though is not limited to) 
          understanding one's own strengths and weaknesses, values, goals and being practicing
          resillience in times of pressure. Empathy also plays a huge role in emotional intelligence.
