            <br><h2>Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.</h2>
       <p>A core personal value of mine would be empathy. “Treat others the way you want to be treated” is a quote I’ve kept in mind for a very long time. I remind myself of this quote every time I am confronted with someone who is giving me a hard time (To know that they are frustrated with something, and to try empathize with them instead of fighting back with my own opinion). This keeps me from being frustrated with people even in the most tension filled times. To go along with this I am pretty optimistic with my view in life, hence I’ve been told I have a calm-demeanor a lot by friends and even my employer. This photo (will insert later) is of me and my life’s biggest role-model, my great-grandmother Tito! She is the biggest example I know of someone who works super hard for other people to benefit off of, yet she has never yearned for attention or rewards for her work. She is completely selfless and humble, and I believe that is why many people within our Niuean community love and respect her. I aspire to be as selfless and humble as her.</p>
     <br><h2>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</h2>
       <p>Through the Briggs Myers test, my personality results were INFJ (advocate / less than 1% of the world's population). A lot of what the results explained what INFJ is, was very accurate for me. According to the test 3 main strengths are empathy, Discernment and Altruism. 3 areas of improvement are being too private (social Anxiety), being a perfectionist and sensitivity to criticism and conflict.</p>
       <br><h2>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h2>
       <p>Off the top of my head would be my choices in education, this also includes studying at Dev Academy. When I first started University last year, my grandparents (whom I stay with) wanted me to study to become a doctor, study law, or study politics. So for the first semester, I half-heartedly took papers in these subjects. Deep down I knew I wasn’t doing something I truly wanted to do. I had always wanted to learn Japanese and move to Japan, so I decided to major in Japanese (despite my Grandparents’ disapproval). This really weighed down on me for a while, consequences of this decision still linger on today within little comments of belittlement such as “Still wasting your time I see”. Though I receive that sort of negativity, I am more excited about the future knowing this is what I’ve chosen to do. With EDA, they have never heard of/ are unaware of a career in programming/web development. They only see success as the careers I’ve mentioned above. Despite the criticism, I intend to move forward chasing what I want to do.</p>
       <br> <h2>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h2>
       <p>Being a Polynesian (Niuean, Cook Island-Maori, Samoan), especially a brown Polynesian has indefinitely influenced the way I identify myself. Growing up with my Niuean family, I was taught to stay humble but still work my ass off. Boasting is a no-no. </p>
       <br> <h2>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h2>
       <p>Throughout my years of study from highschool to tertiary, I believe 2 strengths of mine are dedication to completing the work and having the work ethic required to complete it. Though limitations would definitely be procrastination and time management. Career wise, I believe I am very friendly within a workplace environment and can get along with most people as well as putting in great work ethic no matter what the job is</p>
       <br><h2>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h2>
       <p>I think that my sensitivity/empathy towards others would lead me to offering help to my team and putting in more effort to somewhat work ahead to be able to be more effective in sharing.</p>
       <br><h2>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. </h2>
       <p>Last semester, for one of my papers I had group and we were to do a powerpoint presentation together in front of the class. This involved creating our own slides after researching individual topics, putting them together with edits accordingly, and then finally present them as fluently as possible. To be more productive, I had offered to create a shared google doc/google slides for us all to work within/make notes etc. I also asked them if a group chat on Facebook or Email was alright with them, so we did that. However, as the semester went on 2 of the members went kind of silent via facebook communications. 1 of the members actually did not respond at all until the day of the presentation when he finally sent some slides to incorporate into our group powerpoint. This was unfortunate as our marks depend on the group’s effort.</p>
       <br><h2>Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h2> 
       <p>(Mentioned above)
            Offering shared Google documents/ Keeping in contact via Facebook and Email (about deadlines/drafts/shared thoughts).
            A strategy I would try now, would be to possibly ask him if he needed help researching on his own topic. Though it would be me putting in extra work, I know for a fact I could have used more time towards the group project.</p>
