          Oh man, there was so much I don’t know where to begin. I guess the main thing was because of my lack of engagement in last week’s sprint, I am paying for it now. I got stumped on the smallest of problems such as syntax. I knew parts of the code but to be able to engage in the activity I had to figure out what it was that I was looking at first.
          Going back to last week’s sprint and going through the material I didn’t know as well as googling specific syntax. 
          When going through the Katas I felt absolutely useless, Unlike the previous sprints where I felt constant motion and felt good about coding. Because there was a lot I didn’t do earlier, it felt like I was doing both sprints at the same time. With the deadline approaching, I felt pressured unlike with the last sprints. What I learned was that I really need to put the hours into coding, I feel like I can finally do that now that one of my jobs has ended.

          I feel like Pseudocode  is generally easy to use as long as the statements I make are simply communicative enough for anyone to be able to understand. 
          The Rubber ducky method is gonna take some time to get use to for me, I tend to think everything through in my head but when it comes out I kinda get stuck. Error messages are sort of understandable, I am comfortable with simple errors like ‘This should be an array’, and ‘undefined’ but the rest is also gonna take a while for me to get use to. With console.logging I understand that it prints, and I know how to use it generally. 
          However I still don’t know in what context would this be of use. I need to ask for more help on slack, and have to more quickly get in touch with my facilitator for assistance instead of letting the problem drag out longer wasting unnecessary time.

Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity means that one’s mind is open and will not have a fixed mindset. Knowing that your brain is malleable and not stuck a certain way, it leads to the possibility of purposeful change and re-wiring. 

I will try to make what I am doing more meaningful, for instance, in terms of coding, I will look back at why I am coding in the first place instead of getting stumped about how hard it is. I will also be engaging with the principle “use it or lose it” alot, using coding as an example again, I will make sure to code daily so that the connection pathways continue to get stronger and not die out.


Also Repetitive practice over and over on a problem, plus looking at the problem from different angles (e.g. youtube video tutorial, article reading) to help build stronger connections.

This is an article by huffpost outlining the fundamentals of neuroplasticity. What makes it relevant is that it has links to other author’s books on neuro plasticity making it more credible. It also explains most of the fundamentals with an easy and simple simile, making it easy to understand.



I knew about the brain being malleable and that rewiring was possible but it wasn’t until going over this section of the sprint till I realised “why aren’t I keeping this as a crucial part of my general thinking?”. I feel like understanding more and more of neuroplasticity is a super effective tool I should be utilising more often, especially with coding.

Instead of self labelling myself when I get something wrong as a ‘failure’ or telling myself ‘I can’t do it’, I will remind myself ‘not yet’. I will try my best to reward myself mentally for the process rather than have my sights fixed on ‘getting it all right’. Progress over everything.

Learning Plan:
These understandings help to specify my learning plan, to make more deliberate decisions in what I put my time and effort towards. Learning about neuroplasticity, makes me want to add to my learning plan.
