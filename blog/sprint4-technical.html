          Oh man, there was so much I don’t know where to begin. I guess the main thing was because of my lack of engagement in last week’s sprint, I am paying for it now. I got stumped on the smallest of problems such as syntax. I knew parts of the code but to be able to engage in the activity I had to figure out what it was that I was looking at first.
          Going back to last week’s sprint and going through the material I didn’t know as well as googling specific syntax. 
          When going through the Katas I felt absolutely useless, Unlike the previous sprints where I felt constant motion and felt good about coding. Because there was a lot I didn’t do earlier, it felt like I was doing both sprints at the same time. With the deadline approaching, I felt pressured unlike with the last sprints. What I learned was that I really need to put the hours into coding, I feel like I can finally do that now that one of my jobs has ended.

          I feel like Pseudocode  is generally easy to use as long as the statements I make are simply communicative enough for anyone to be able to understand. 
          The Rubber ducky method is gonna take some time to get use to for me, I tend to think everything through in my head but when it comes out I kinda get stuck. Error messages are sort of understandable, I am comfortable with simple errors like ‘This should be an array’, and ‘undefined’ but the rest is also gonna take a while for me to get use to. With console.logging I understand that it prints, and I know how to use it generally. 
          However I still don’t know in what context would this be of use. I need to ask for more help on slack, and have to more quickly get in touch with my facilitator for assistance instead of letting the problem drag out longer wasting unnecessary time.
