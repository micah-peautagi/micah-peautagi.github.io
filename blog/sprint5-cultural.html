    <h1>Foundations Core Skills Reflections</h1>
    <br><br>
    <h3>Describe the impact the core learning has had on your Foundations learning journey.</h3>
      <p>
            It’s impacted my learning journey more than I thought it would. I would say it helped facilitate a better frame of mind as it was constantly reminding me of techniques to manage myself emotionally etc.

      <h3>What are 1 - 3 new things you have learned about yourself as a result of the core learning?</h3>
      <p>
            I learnt that no matter how hard something is, 
            that my brain gauges neuroplasticity and that with 
            practice and perseverance I can learn to code 
            (which I surprise myself by doing often). And that I tend to look down upon my work (in this case coding) as I completely shunned away from sharing my work via slack channel.
      </p>
      <br><br>

      <h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
      <p>
        I think what surprised me the most was the flexibility of it, that it didn’t feel like work really but more so fun and a pleasure (like sunday newspaper reading if anyone still does that).

      </p>
      <br><br>

      <h3>What was the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
      <p>
            I guess getting over the barrier I made myself of “this is cheesy” and “I already know all of this stuff” and trying to embrace it as much as the technical part.

      </p>
      <br><br>

      <h3>Any thoughts you want to share about your core learning journey in Foundations?</h3>
      <p>
            I would to people I get to know better in time but not right away.
