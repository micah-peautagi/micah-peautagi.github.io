      <h2>Learning Agreement</h2>
      <br><br>
      <p>I WILL stay committed to this programme! Monday to Friday I will study from 3pm to 11pm on the days where I do not have afternoon work, and on the days I do I will put the hours in through the weekend. I will be sure to sustain myself well by doing grocery shopping with ‘good’ foods and not get in the habit of eating study stress food (a.k.a. Chocolate etc). I will communicate via slack with my facilitator and peers, and offer help where I am able to give.
        </p>

      <br><br>
      
      <h3>GOAL</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        <bold>I AM <bold> going to Japan and teach English. I want to get remote developer work to be able to have stable income wherever I decide to travel to.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h4>Strengths & Limitations
</h4>
      <p>
        I am friendly (Approachable) and get along well with people. Sometimes I used to let people walk over me.
        To set safe and strong boundaries for myself, I will let people know with confidence when there is something I am not okay with what they are doing that is affecting me.
        I will also remove myself from any negative situations. I'd say I am also good with communication when it comes to doing work, by taking the initiative to promote team efficiency, breaking down and delegating tasks and overall being clear and honest when I communicate. I also am willing to do the work to benefit others in a team situation. 
        </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        
      </p>

      <br><br>

      <h4>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h4>
      <p>I will first google for the answers I’m looking for, and if that doesn’t help I will seek help via cohort friends or the foundations slack channel. Last resort is to ask my facilitator, I was advised it is better to ask and get the answer faster rather than spend an unhealthy amount of time searching for it.
        </p>

      <br><br>


      <h4>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h4>
      <p>Schedule: Now that my teacher aide job has ended I can put forward more time to coding.
        </p>

      <h2> Sprint 5: Learning Agreement update </h2>
      <br><br>

      <h4>Have you noticed your strengths in practice?</h4>
      <br>
        <p>Yes, especially in last week's sprint. Due to my lack of course engagement in sprint 3, I felt it was almost impossible to keep up with the rest of the incoming work. 
        As it felt like I was doing two sprints at once at one point, I'm suprised that I was actually progressing instead of stopping and feeling absolutely miserable.
        </p> 
        <br><br>
      <h4>Had any setbacks or challenges that week?</h4>
      <br>
       <p>
        I noticed that despite saying work ethic is a strong point is mine, I guess it doesn't do any good if I
        don't put schedule enough time for me to be working. With sprint 3 I failed to manage my time efficiently and endud up not getting alot of sprint 3 done,
        therefore when it came to sprint 4 and even now during sprint 5 it feels as if I am still playing catch up.
       </p>
       <br><br>
      <h4>What did you do to overcome these?</h4>
      <br>
        <p>
          By just perservering and continuing on with the challenges and looking up anything I didn't understand. 
        </p>
       <br><br>
      <h4> What will you differently next time?</h4>
      <br>
      <p>
        Next time I will definately organise my time more practically and realistically.
        I will also I ask for help sooner than later!
      </p>
<br><br>
      <h4>What was a highlight for you?</h4>
      <br>
      <p>
        A highlight for me would be being able to understand and read the code used for the minesweeper game,
        knowing the practical use for any of the code makes me feel more confident in my learning pursuit.
      </p>
        

      <h3>Skills I want to develop at EDA:</h3>
      <br>
      <p>
        While I am here at EDA, I want to develop confidence in my technical ability.
        I want to be proud of my work and the skills I've learn't to make it so that I can demonstrate it to future employers.
        I also want to develop confidence when presenting my work to others, as well as teamwork (taking the harder option so I can benefit more from the challenge).
