      <h2>Learning Agreement</h2>
      <br><br>
      <p>I WILL stay committed to this programme! Monday to Friday I will study from 3pm to 11pm on the days where I do not have afternoon work, and on the days I do I will put the hours in through the weekend. I will be sure to sustain myself well by doing grocery shopping with ‘good’ foods and not get in the habit of eating study stress food (a.k.a. Chocolate etc). I will communicate via slack with my facilitator and peers, and offer help where I am able to give.
        </p>

      <br><br>

      <h4>Strengths & Limitations
</h4>
      <p>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.
        </p>

      <br><br>

      <h4>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h4>
      <p>I will first google for the answers I’m looking for, and if that doesn’t help I will seek help via cohort friends or the foundations slack channel. Last resort is to ask my facilitator, I was advised it is better to ask and get the answer faster rather than spend an unhealthy amount of time searching for it.
        </p>

      <br><br>

      <h4>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h4>
      <p>What I expect from the facilitation team: Lollies when completing a sprint lol, nah, just a truly caring group of people who actually want to make a difference in our lives by facilitating to the best of their abilities (we can tell).
        </p>
      <br><br>

      <h4>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.</h4>
      <p>Schedule: Until December 14th, Monday to Friday I have work from 8:00am to 2:30pm with extra occasional work from 6pm-2am. Including travel time between home and work, the days where I work in the afternoon as well, I am unavailable to code the entire day. (Days are different each week for the afternoon hours, will notify which days I will be completely unavailable.
